You are a corporate employee, whose home, nation and family are all contained within the womb of your corporation. You can expect pressure to perform from your superiors and peers. You can expect deadly serious competition from your competitors and you can expect rich rewards if your team can succeed and demonstrate you’re the best in the business. </p> <p>Having said that, although, in character, individual and team success is prioritised, the game is designed for cooperation between teams and across boundaries to be the only real way to get the best out of the game. This means that it’s expected for players to transgress the IC boundaries and requirements but also that the game world will respond as should be expected towards law breakers and counter cultural behaviour. </p> <p>One of the questions we want to ask is, if you could succeed without thinking about other people, would you choose another way to help them when you don’t need to. </p> <h2>Background</h2> <p>We have run several games in this setting but each is stand alone with different themes. </p> <h3>Our key principles are these:</h3> <ul> <li>No prior knowledge of the world, its politics or its threats is required to play as our games are designed to be played on their own terms</li> <li>We design games to provide challenges that can lead to character death as a normal part of the experience</li> <li>There is no winning our games</li> <li>We want people to have fun and, as a result, there is no right way to play the game - solutions to problems will be entirely driven by players</li> <li>Our ruleset is cinematic in feel - the rules are there to help provide boundaries but are flexible and designed to maximise moments of cool and moments of intense emotion</li> <li>Combat can depend on the nature of the game. Alone Elysium will have two types of combat - freeform player led and a laser tag system for competitive PVP elements. The presence of these two out of character (OOC) mechanics will be explained within the narrative of the game</li> <li>Our writing team will work with each player ahead of the game to create a character that feels ‘lived in’ and who will have connections to other characters in the game, secrets, agendas and aims that will inform their experience. No one will be left behind and everyone will be given the chance to develop a strong initial character.</li> <li>We operate a very high trust environment - players largely determine whether what they do works and there are minimal Non-player Characters (NPCs) - our last game ran with none. <ul> <li>we are not trying to win, we are trying to create drama, relationships, conflict, laughter and camaraderie. We succeed by telling a story as a community not by ‘winning’ a fight or by beating others even if, in the game itself, these are of paramount importance.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Given the high trust nature of the game, people who take the piss or OOC fuck about will be asked to change their approach. Failure to do so will see them removed from the game.</li> <li>We tolerate no prejudices of any kind and players who break these rules will be removed from the game and asked to leave site</li> </ul> <h2>The Game</h2> <p>Alone Elysium will feature two complete games running side by side with only minimal contact between each setting. Having said that, contact between the two games is a central part of the experience and will shape the outcomes of everyone on both sides.</p> <p>The game is a PVPVE game. By PVPVE we mean that it will feature elements where the challenges to be managed originate with other players (PVP) as well as challenges that come from the gameworld and environment itself (PVE). It will have strong elements of interpersonal conflict, intense roleplay and expected character death (in each of the Alone games the majority of characters die and sometimes players get through many characters over the course of a single event - the record is 17).</p> <h2>This larp is for you if you enjoy the following content:</h2> <ul> <li>exploring difficult questions about humanity, conflict, collaboration, competition, capitalism, survival and inequality</li> <li>characters with a collaboratively developed backstory and meaningful connections</li> <li>immersive experience with 40h of continuous play time (the game will run from 8pm Friday until it finishes sometime in the early hours of Sunday morning)</li> <li>being a part of a team, solving mysteries, seeking novel solutions when the world gives you no levers </li> <li>political play and tough negotiations</li> <li>tense combat and physical challenges where death is a part of the normal experience</li> <li>a game with strong emotions around interpersonal drama</li> </ul> <p>This game is not for you if:</p> <ul> <li>You need to have a happy ending</li> </ul> <h2>Costumes and Kit</h2> <p>We are aware that many players will experience character death. The game is designed to provide clear guidelines for character appearance and those most at risk of dying will be in a situation in which their kit can be reused without that presenting a problem.</p> <p>Overall we will provide clear examples of kit and keep our focus on being able to be part of the game without needing to source expensive kit. </p> <p>These is a laser tag element to game for which we will provide equipment to all those who need it. Additional weapons permissible will be briefed but for melee weapons, they must be larp appropriate (LARP safe) and for firearms they must be pre-agreed with game organisers ahead of the game.</p> <h2>Location, Dates and Cost</h2> <p>We will be running our game at Youlbury Scout camp in Oxfordshire [address here]. It is a fantastic site and we will have the site exclusively for the game. It will have bunks and washing facilities for everyone.</p> <p>The event will be fully catered.</p> <p>We will run from Friday 27th Feb to Sunday Mar 1st, 2026.</p> <p>The game is for up to 85 players. We will operate a waiting list on a first come first served basis for those who wish to attend beyond that.</p> <p>Tickets: </p> <ul> <li>Concession - £200 [need details for what qualifies]</li> <li>Standard Price - £300</li> <li>Supporter Tier 1 - £350 (goodies to be announced)</li> <li>Supporter tier 2 - £450 (extra goodies to be announced)</li> </ul> <p>The two supporter tiers help us fund the Concession prices and would really help us afford to run the game as well as make sure people who would love to come can come.</p> <p>We are happy to allow people to pay in installments over three months via standing order (proof of standing order being set up will be required).</p> </section> <footer> <ul class="footer-links"> <li class="cta"><a href="https://forms.gle/Fy2K8oJtMKUnHcNA6">Register interest</a></li> <li><a href="thegame.html">The Game</a></li> <li><a href="faq.html"><abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr></a></li> <li><a href="contentwarning.html">Content Warning</a></li> <li><a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></li> <li><a href="gdpr-statement.html"><abbr general data protection regulation>GDPR</abbr> Statement</a></li> <li>Brought to you by <svg id="flowstate-logo" fill="none" role="image" viewBox="0 0 383 56"><title>Flowstate LARP logo</title><path fill="#fff" d="M22.22 30.122H5.735v23.51q0 1.65-2.867 1.65T0 53.631V14.497Q0 7.829 2.58 4.89q2.58-3.01 8.745-3.01h13.763q1.433 0 1.433 2.509t-1.433 2.508H11.325q-3.082 0-4.372 1.72-1.219 1.722-1.219 5.878v10.61h16.487q1.433 0 1.433 2.508t-1.433 2.509M46.465 49.905h11.612q1.434 0 1.434 2.51 0 2.508-1.434 2.508H46.465q-6.164 0-8.745-2.939-2.58-3.01-2.58-9.677V3.17q0-1.649 2.867-1.649t2.867 1.65v39.136q0 4.158 1.219 5.878 1.29 1.72 4.372 1.72M100.581 12.13v32.543q0 5.949-4.66 8.673-4.587 2.652-12.185 2.652-16.343 0-16.343-11.325V12.13q0-5.949 4.587-8.601Q76.64.805 84.238.805q16.343 0 16.343 11.325m-27.454-.717V45.39q0 5.59 10.824 5.59 10.895 0 10.895-5.59V11.413q0-5.59-10.895-5.59-10.824 0-10.824 5.59M150.332 45.39q.359 2.938 1.649 4.3 1.29 1.29 4.229 1.29 3.01 0 4.158-1.29 1.146-1.29 1.577-4.3l5.591-42.22q.215-1.649 2.938-1.649 2.796 0 2.796 1.434l-5.734 43.223q-.646 5.232-3.083 7.526-2.436 2.294-8.243 2.294-5.734 0-8.243-2.294-2.509-2.365-2.939-7.526l-1.648-17.633h-.717l-1.649 17.633q-.502 5.161-3.01 7.526-2.437 2.294-8.244 2.294-5.734 0-8.171-2.294t-3.082-7.526l-5.735-43.366q0-1.29 2.724-1.29 2.796 0 3.011 1.648l5.591 42.22q.43 3.01 1.505 4.3 1.147 1.29 4.157 1.29t4.229-1.29q1.291-1.362 1.721-4.3l4.444-35.697q.215-1.65 2.867-1.649t2.867 1.649zM211.072 45.39v-8.1q0-2.365-1.864-3.441-1.863-1.076-6.451-2.15l-6.379-1.434q-4.372-1.004-6.595-2.222-4.731-2.509-4.731-10.394V12.13q0-5.949 4.229-8.601Q193.583.805 200.607.805t11.254 2.724q4.229 2.652 4.229 8.601v3.154q0 1.65-2.868 1.649t-2.867-1.649v-3.87q0-5.592-9.82-5.592-9.748 0-9.748 5.591v6.093q0 3.942 1.147 5.448 1.218 1.433 4.444 2.15l6.379 1.434q6.882 1.505 7.813 2.078l2.294 1.147q1.29.645 1.72 1.362.502.645 1.147 1.649 1.075 1.648 1.075 5.09v6.809q0 5.877-4.73 8.601-4.66 2.724-11.828 2.724-7.096 0-11.683-2.724-4.516-2.724-4.516-8.601v-3.154q0-1.65 2.867-1.649t2.867 1.649v3.87q0 2.94 2.939 4.301 3.01 1.29 7.526 1.29 4.588 0 7.67-1.361 3.154-1.362 3.154-4.23M225.421 1.88h30.106q1.433 0 1.433 2.509t-1.433 2.508h-12.186v46.736q0 1.648-2.867 1.648t-2.867-1.648V6.897h-12.186q-1.433 0-1.433-2.508 0-2.51 1.433-2.51M299.467 12.13v41.503q0 1.648-2.868 1.648t-2.867-1.648V34.207h-21.719v19.426q0 1.648-2.867 1.648t-2.867-1.648V12.13q0-4.014 2.365-6.594 2.365-2.653 6.021-3.656 3.656-1.075 8.602-1.075 16.2 0 16.2 11.325m-27.454-.717V29.19h21.719V11.413q0-5.59-10.895-5.59-10.824 0-10.824 5.59M310.191 1.88h30.105q1.434 0 1.434 2.509t-1.434 2.508h-12.185v46.736q0 1.648-2.867 1.648t-2.867-1.648V6.897h-12.186q-1.434 0-1.434-2.508 0-2.51 1.434-2.51M356.066 36.43v8.96q0 5.59 10.107 5.59 10.178 0 10.178-5.59v-5.162q0-1.648 2.868-1.648t2.867 1.648v4.445q0 5.949-4.301 8.673-4.3 2.652-11.54 2.652-7.168 0-11.541-2.652-4.372-2.724-4.372-8.673v-8.244q0-7.382 6.307-8.888-5.59-1.72-5.591-8.745V12.13q0-5.949 4.373-8.601 4.372-2.724 11.11-2.724 6.81 0 10.752 2.724 3.942 2.723 3.943 8.601v1.075q0 1.65-2.868 1.649t-2.867-1.649v-1.792q0-5.59-9.39-5.59-9.318 0-9.318 5.59v7.383q0 6.309 7.741 6.308h5.376q1.434 0 1.434 2.509t-1.434 2.509h-6.093q-7.741 0-7.741 6.307"/></svg>, est. 2020</li> </ul> </footer> </body></html>
