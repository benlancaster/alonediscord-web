This privacy policy will inform you as to how we look after your personal data and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</p> <p>Please also use the Glossary to understand the meaning of some of the terms used in this privacy policy.</p> <h3>1. Important information and who we are</h3> <p>Purpose of this privacy policy</p> <p>This privacy policy aims to give you information on how Flowstate collects and processes your personal data as supplied to us.</p> <p>Our events are not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect data relating to children.</p> <p>It is important that you read this privacy policy together with any other privacy policy or fair processing policy we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This privacy policy supplements other notices and privacy policies and is not intended to override them.</p> <h4>Controller</h4> <p>Claire Potter, on behalf of Flowstate, is the controller and responsible for your personal data (collectively referred to as "Flowstate", "we", "us" or "our" in this privacy policy).</p> <p>We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy policy. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the DPO using the details set out below.</p> <h4>Contact details</h4> <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, please contact our DPO in the following ways:</p> <dl> <dt>Name:</dt> <dd>Claire Potter</dd> <dt>Email address</dt> <dd><a href="mailto:mail@alonediscord.com">mail@alonediscord.com</a></dd> </dl> <p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.</p> <h4>Changes to the privacy policy and your duty to inform us of changes</h4> <p>We keep our privacy policy under regular review. This version (v1) was last updated on 31st January 2020. Historic versions, where applicable, can be obtained by contacting us.</p> <p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p> <h3>2. The data we collect about you</h3> <p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p> <p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Identity Data includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier, title, date of birth and gender. </li> <li>Contact Data includes address, email address and telephone numbers.</li> <li>Transaction Data includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us. </li> <li>Personal Data includes details about emergency contacts and/or next of kin, any dietary requirements and any pertinent medical conditions. </li> </ul> <p>Some of the data we collect is classified as Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). In relation to our policies regarding storing and processing this data, please also see our Appropriate Policy Document.</p> <p>If you fail to provide personal data</p> <p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to book you onto an event). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p> <p>Where possible the choice to provide data to us will be optional.</p> <h3>3. How is your personal data collected?</h3> <p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:</p> <ul> <li>Direct interactions. You may give us your Identity, Contact and Personal Data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide when you: </li> <li>apply to attend one of our events (as a player, crew or otherwise);</li> <li>create an account on our website (which applicable);</li> <li>subscribe to our service, publications or mailing lists;</li> <li>request event information to be sent to you; or</li> <li>give us feedback or contact us.</li> </ul> <h3>4. How we use your personal data</h3> <p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p> <ul> <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li> <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. </li> <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li> </ul> <p>Please see the Glossary section for Lawful Basis at the end of this document for more information about the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your personal data.</p> <p>We also rely on your consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data, which we will request of you when you make a booking to attend one of our events (as a player, crew or otherwise). You have the right to withdraw consent at any time by contacting us.</p> <h4>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</h4> <p>We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.</p> <p>Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Purpose/Activity</th> <th>Type of data</th> <th>Lawful basis for processing including basis of legitimate interest</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <th scope="row">To register you as a potential customer</th> <td>(a) Identity<br> (b) Contact </td> <td>(a) Necessary for our legitimate interests (to allow up to keep you updated about our events)<br> (b) Consent </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row">To register you as attending one of our events (as a player, crew or otherwise)</th> <td>(a) Identity<br> (b) Contact<br> (c) Personal </td> <td>(a) Performance of a contract with you<br> (b) Necessary for out legitimate interests (to manage event attendance, plan catering, analyse event risk, plan first aid provision)<br> (c) Consent </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row">To process your booking including manage payments, fees and charges</th> <td>(a) Identity<br> (b) Contact </td> <td>(c) Transaction<br> (a) Performance of a contract with you<br> (b) Necessary for our legitimate interests (to administer payments) </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row">To manage our relationship with you which will include:<br> (a) Notifying you about changes to our terms or privacy policy<br> (b) Asking you to leave a review or take a survey </th> <td>(a) Identity<br> (b) Contact </td> <td>(a) Performance of a contract with you<br> (b) Necessary to comply with a legal obligation<br> (c) Necessary for our legitimate interests (to keep our records updated and to study how customers use our products/services) </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4>Marketing</h4> <p>We will only provide information about events that we are running. We will not use any data you have provided for 3rd party marketing.</p> <h4>Opting out</h4> <p>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at any time.</p> <h4>Change of purpose</h4> <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.</p> <p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p> <p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p> <h3>5.

We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p> <h3>6. International transfers</h3> <p>We may store your data on IT platforms that have servers located outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).</p> <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented [DELETE AS APPLICABLE]:</p> <ul> <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries. </li> <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries. </li> <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. </li> </ul> <p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p> <h3>7.0Data security</h3> <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p> <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p> <h3>8. Data retention</h3> <p>How long will you use my personal data for?</p> <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p> <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p> <p>In relation to the Personal Data you may provide to us, this will only be retained up to a maximum of 60 days following the end date of the event for which it was provided at which point it will be destroyed.</p> <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.</p> <h3>9. Your legal rights</h3> <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.

However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p> <h4>What we may need from you</h4> <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p> <h4>Time limit to respond</h4> <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p> <h3>10. Glossary</h3> <h4>LAWFUL BASIS</h4> <p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p> <p><strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p> <p><strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</p> <h4>THIRD PARTIES</h4> <h5>Internal Third Parties</h5> <p>Flowstate is a consortium of individual organisers working under a collective banner to deliver our events. Your data may be accessible by any of this team for any legitimate purpose surrounding our work. For a list of who is involved in Flowstate at any time, please contact us.</p> <h5>External Third Parties</h5> <ul> <li>Service providers, including caters and medical support providers.</li> <li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services. </li> <li>HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances. </li> </ul> <h4>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h4> <p>You have the right to:</p> <p>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p> <p>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p> <p>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p> <p>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p> <p>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li> <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li> <li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. </li> <li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. </li> </ul> <p>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p> <p>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p> </section> <footer> <ul class="footer-links"> <li class="cta"><a href="#">Register interest</a></li> <li><a href="thegame.html">The Game</a></li> <li><a href="faq.html"><abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr></a></li> <li><a href="contentwarning.html">Content Warning</a></li> <li><a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></li> <li><a href="gdpr-statement.html"><abbr general data protection regulation>GDPR</abbr> Statement</a></li> <li>Brought to you by Flowstate, est. 2020</li> </ul> </footer> </body></html>
