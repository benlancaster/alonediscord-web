Compliance with data protection principles</h2> <p>5.1 Lawfulness, fairness and transparency</p> <p>Personal Data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the Data Subject.</p> <p>We will only Process Personal Data fairly and lawfully and for specified purposes. The GDPR restricts our actions regarding Personal Data to specified lawful purposes. We can Process Special Categories of Personal Data and Criminal Convictions Data only if we have a legal ground for Processing and one of the specific Processing conditions relating to Special Categories of Personal Data or Criminal Convictions Data applies. We will identify and document the legal ground and specific Processing condition relied on for each Processing activity.</p> <p>When collecting Special Categories of Personal Data and Criminal Convictions Data from Data Subjects, either directly from Data Subjects or indirectly (for example from a third party or publicly available source), we will provide Data Subjects with a Privacy Notice setting out all the information required by the GDPR in a privacy notice which is concise, transparent, intelligible, easily accessible and in clear plain language which can be easily understood.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th scope="col">Lawful Processing basis</th> <th scope="col">Processing condition for Special Categories of Personal Data</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <th scope="row"><p>Data concerning health</p> <p>Compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6 (1)(c)) or necessary for the performance of a contract with the Data Subject (Article 6(1)(b)).</p> </th> <td> <p>Necessary for the purposes of performing or exercising obligations or rights which are imposed or conferred by law on the controller or the Data Subject in connection with employment, social security or social protection.</p> <p>(Paragraph 1(1)(a), Schedule 1, DPA 2018.)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row"><p><strong>Racial or ethnic origin data</strong></p> <p>Compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6(1)(c)).</p></th> <td> <p>Necessary for the purposes of performing or exercising obligations or rights which are imposed or conferred by law on the controller or the Data Subject in connection with employment, social security or social protection.</p> <p>(Paragraph 1(1)(a), Schedule 1, DPA 2018.)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row"><p>Criminal Convictions Data</p> <p>Compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6(1)(c)).</p> <p>OR</p> <p>In the organisation's legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)) which are not outweighed by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject.</p></th> <td> <p>Necessary for the purposes of performing or exercising obligations or rights which are imposed or conferred by law on the Controller or the Data Subject in connection with employment, social security or social protection.</p> <p>(Paragraph 1(1)(a), Schedule 1, DPA 2018.)</p> <p>Meets one of the substantial public interest conditions set out in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the DPA 2018 (such as preventing or detecting unlawful acts).</p> <p>(Paragraph 10(1), Schedule 1, DPA 2018.)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row"> <p>Equal opportunity data</p> <p>In the organisation's legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f)) which are not outweighed by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject.</p> </th> <td> <p>Necessary for the purposes of identifying or keeping under review the existence or absence of equality of opportunity or treatment between groups of people specified in relation to that category with a view to enabling such equality to be promoted or maintained.</p> <p>(Paragraph 8(1)(b), Schedule 1, DPA 2018.)</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>5.2 Purpose limitation</p> <p>Personal Data must be collected only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes.
